Files: 

 - diffusion1d.ipynb
 
    A simple serial example of 1d diffusion equation for starting creating an
    MPI equivalent. Creation of MPI counterpart is shown in the files step1.py - 
    step6.py.
 
 - step1.py
 
    Illustrates using mpi4py Python package for MPI, and creating multiple
    MPI ranks running on several processes.
 
 - step2.py
 
    Adds code that illustrates basic message sending between ranks using
    MPI. 


 - step3.py
 
    Introduces code that divides the indices of a global vector into
    local blocks of indices split over ranks.
 
 - step4.py
 
 - step5.py
 
 - step6.py
